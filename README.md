Album
=====

Include album: You can upload pictures and delete album. This is very simple blog to learn so many things.



This blog is based on the example : -

A simple application where user can have many albums and album can have many photos. User should be able to upload multiple photos while creating new album by clicking on "Add More Photo" (Use accepts_nested_attributes for multimodel form). Photos can also have multiple tags(comma separated)(Not use any tagging plugin/gem). Thumbnails must be created for each photo after uploading. Album and associated photos with tags should be created simultaneously. Also include Unit and Functional test.

Not use scaffold.
